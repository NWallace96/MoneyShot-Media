                                        <p>
                                            To some entrepreneurs, social media marketing is the “next big thing,” a temporary yet powerful fad that must be taken advantage of while it’s still in the spotlight.
                                            To others, it’s a buzzword with no practical advantages and a steep, complicated learning curve.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Because it appeared quickly, social media has developed a reputation by some for being a passing marketing interest, and therefore, an unprofitable one. The statistics,
                                            however, illustrate a different picture. According to Hubspot, 92% of marketers in 2014 claimed that social media marketing was important for their business,
                                            with 80% indicating their efforts increased traffic to their websites. And according to Social Media Examiner, 97% of marketers are currently participating in social media—but 85% of participants
                                            aren’t sure what social media tools are the best to use.

                                        <h3>Market Analysis</h3>
                                        <p>When you are an investor or even an entrepreneur you need to know what you are getting yourself into. You need to have all the data to back up your goal or vision for the company. For this reason, you need to do a marketing analysis.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            We check for profitability. If the market is showing signs of return on investment you will be encouraged to invest heavily. Similarly if the market isn’t profitable then you will hesitate for wasting your time and resources.
                                            We try to understand the customers. You try to find out what it is that they want and try to provide them with that exact product or services.
                                            We try to find out who your real competitors are. You make sure you calculate all the risks that may arise.
